# Frontend Mentor - Crowdfunding product page solution

This is a solution to the [Crowdfunding product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR).
I used a different color palette (no offense to frontendmentor üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), and decided to add a footer to this project.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
  - Here, users can see some basic form validation on 'keyup' and 'blur'
  - Also, users can see how the 'Mahogany Special Edition' pledge section gets disabled when there are no pledges left
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one, and pledges left decrement by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked
- See the changes remain even after refreshing the page for a single seesion
- Click on the social media icons directing them to that social media profile page
- See how the number of days left dynamically change after 12 noon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript (with sessionStorage)


### What I learned

In the course of building this project, I learnt a lot of cool and awesome stuffs. Listed below, are some of the new tricks I am happy to have under my sleeve:

```html
<svg class="class-name">
  <use xlink:href="some-path"></use>
</svg>
<!-- I learnt how to manipulate SVGs with this tags -->
```
```css
.class-name li:not(:last-child)::after {
  all: unset;
}
/*
 - The above css selector saved me the stress of adding extra classes to html elements
 - The all property and unset value helped me to reset css styles added to selector elements
*/

.btn {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
}
/*
This css property and value helped with the default blue highlight color when a button is clicked
*/
```
```js
let x = "89,914";
console.log(x.split(",").join(""));
//output - "89914";
//split and join methods helped with getting rid of the comma
```

### Continued development

Since this is my first project implementing JavaScript, I am proud of what this project turned out to be. I really wanted to test my state management with Vanilla JavaScript. But, I know I have a long way to go. I really need to master arrow functions and ES6 JavaScript syntaxes, and many more.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - A great help. I always feel intimidated and motivated when I look for answers here.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - A helpful resource when those little things get mixed up in my head.
